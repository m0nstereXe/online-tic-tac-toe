In server, maintain list of active games
  boardstate, 1 or 2 players?
  each item in the list is a button and if u click on a game with one player it should put you in that game!

Create btn that creates a new game then sends that 2 server
  server should tell u if u are X or O and then add ur game to the game list

Server should send the game list to every user not in a game once every 10 seconds

somehow figure out the difference between 2 users



EVERY SESSION HAS ITS OWN ID
